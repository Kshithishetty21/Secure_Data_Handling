# 🔐 Secure Data Handling Web Application

This project is a Flask-based web application that demonstrates essential security operations such as **data encryption, decryption**, and **digital signature simulation**. It includes a **modern dark-themed UI**, smooth animations, and **logs all secure actions** to a local file.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Symmetric encryption and decryption using Python's `cryptography` library
- ✍️ Digital signature simulation using RSA key pair
- 🗃️ Secure data logging to a local file (`secure_data_log.txt`)
- 🌙 Sleek, responsive dark-themed user interface with icons and hover animations
- 🌐 Web-based application built with Flask

## 📸 Working Output

### 🔷 User Interface
A stylish front-end where users can:
- Enter a message
- Encrypt it
- Decrypt an encrypted message
- Simulate a digital signature check

## 🧪 How It Works

- **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses `Fernet` from the `cryptography` library for AES encryption.
- **Asymmetric Signature:** Simulates RSA key generation, signing, and verification.
- **Logging:** All actions are timestamped and written to `secure_data_log.txt`.
- **Frontend:** Built with HTML and CSS (Dark Mode, Icons, Animations)
